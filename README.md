# Fibroid_Adenomyosis_Classification
This repository is a deep learning project for classification of ultrasound images with labels of Fibroid, Adenomyosis and None of the above.

This repository is organised as follows:
1) Pre Processing Pipeline - This Directory Contains the work of preprocessing pipeline developed for the ultrasound images.
2) Model Comparison - This Directory contains the files of before and after the application of the pipeline with usage of Deep Learning Model.
3) UNet Implementation - Contains the work of custom developed ANN as the backbone of UNet and trained over the obtained dataset of images.

# Availability of the Dataset - 
The images used in this dataset are not available for public use and are were provided by the hospital which the study was tied up with.
